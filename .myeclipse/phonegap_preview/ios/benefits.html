        				1. No Commute. As we know or have experienced.
        				If you work at the typical office, you need to
        				actually be in the office. Or in some cases as
        				in sales, you need to be in the field. Working
        				at home frees up at least 3 hours a day. That’s
        				the average time it takes for a person to dress
        				up and travel to and from the office. That’s
        				three hours you can devote to other things like,
        				sleeping, spending time with your family.
        				FACEBOOK, household chores, or if you’re lucky a
        				part time job.
        			</p>
        			<p align="left">
        				2. No Extra Expenses (in some things.) You get
        				to save cash, hard earned cash that you worked
        				for. Why? no commute means you don’t pay for
        				fare. No expenses on keeping your office
        				wardrobe updated. No eating out.
        			</p>
        			<p align="left">
        				3. Less Stress. (some points are more applicable
        				to women) – choosing what to wear for the day
        				-traffic -seeing your co workers -seeing your
        				boss -being late and fined or penalized
        			</p>
        			<p align="left">
        				4. Eating home cooked food. being able to eat
        				what you want, when you want without being
        				charged an arm and a leg to get it. And
        				hopefully eating healthy foods.
        			</p>
        			<p align="left">
        				5. Almost safe from external factors. (except of
        				course for natural calamities) -no worries on
        				being kidnaped -raped -robbed -car breaking down
        				-no number coding scheme.
        			</p>
        			<p align="left">
        				6. Spending quality family time with your Family
        				and friends. .
